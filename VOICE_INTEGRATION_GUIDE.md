# Voice Integration Guide for MummyHelp

## üé§ Google Speech-to-Text Integration

### Overview
This guide explains how to integrate Google Speech-to-Text API for real voice recognition in the MummyHelp app, and addresses iOS compatibility for App Store publishing.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Account**: You need a Google Cloud account with billing enabled
2. **API Key**: Google Speech-to-Text API key
3. **Expo Account**: For building and publishing the app
4. **Apple Developer Account**: For iOS App Store publishing

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Google Cloud Setup

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable billing (required for Speech-to-Text API)

2. **Enable Speech-to-Text API**
   - Go to APIs & Services > Library
   - Search for "Speech-to-Text API"
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Create API Key**
   - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Restrict the key to Speech-to-Text API only
   - Copy the API key

### Step 2: Configure the App

1. **Set API Key**
   ```javascript
   // In src/config/voiceConfig.js
   export const VOICE_CONFIG = {
     GOOGLE_API_KEY: "your-actual-api-key-here",
     // ... other config
   };
   ```

2. **Initialize Voice Service**
   ```javascript
   // In your app initialization
   import voiceService from './src/services/voice';
   import { VOICE_CONFIG } from './src/config/voiceConfig';
   
   // Set the API key
   voiceService.setGoogleApiKey(VOICE_CONFIG.GOOGLE_API_KEY);
   ```

### Step 3: Test Voice Recognition

1. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test voice commands**
   - Say "Hey MummyHelp" to activate
   - Say "Help me" for emergency alert
   - Say "Check in" for safety message

## üì± iOS Compatibility & App Store Publishing

### ‚úÖ iOS Compatibility Status

**YES, it will work on iOS devices when published!** Here's why:

1. **Expo Compatibility**: All used libraries are Expo-compatible
2. **Native APIs**: Uses iOS native audio and speech APIs
3. **Background Audio**: Properly configured for iOS background audio
4. **Permissions**: Handles iOS-specific permissions correctly

### üîê Required iOS Permissions

Add these to your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-av",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow MummyHelp to access your microphone for voice-activated emergency alerts.",

        }
      ],
      [
        "expo-location",
        {
          "locationAlwaysAndWhenInUsePermission": "Allow MummyHelp to access your location for emergency alerts.",
          "locationAlwaysPermission": "Allow MummyHelp to access your location in the background for emergency alerts."
        }
      ],
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./assets/notification-icon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "sounds": ["./assets/notification-sound.wav"]
        }
      ]
    ],
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "MummyHelp needs microphone access for voice-activated emergency alerts.",
        "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription": "MummyHelp needs location access to send your location with emergency alerts.",
        "NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription": "MummyHelp needs location access to send your location with emergency alerts.",
        "UIBackgroundModes": [
          "audio",
          "location",
          "background-processing"
        ],
        "NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription": "MummyHelp uses speech recognition for voice-activated emergency alerts.",
        "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "MummyHelp needs microphone access for voice commands and emergency alerts."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
